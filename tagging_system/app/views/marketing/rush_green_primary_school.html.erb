                  <li>It is much larger than an average sized primary school (800+ pupils).</li>
                  <li>It has an above average number of pupils eligible for Pupil Premium. The number of disabled pupils, as well as those with SEN, supported by School Action is well above the average found nationally.</li>

                  <h3>Impact on confidence</h3>
                  <p>We targeted the pupils who tend to get a bit lost in the classroom and are not confident with putting their hands up. With the one-to-one tuition, they’ve got someone on tap all the time to ask anything they need to.</p>

                  <h3>Confidence-wise, the pupils have grown and grown.</h3>
                  <p>I can remember a girl from last year who walked out of a session and said, ‘I never liked Maths until I did this, and now I understand it. Now, I like it.’ That was really what made it for us. We had to carry on the programme.</p>

                  <h3>Positive response from pupils</h3>
                  <p>They absolutely love it. We have pupils coming out of sessions who have not really accessed Maths now finishing and saying ‘I had a really good session today. I loved it,’ which is just so positive.</p>
                  <p>Our pupils’ attitudes have really improved. There are two pupils in particular who find Maths really difficult and don’t contribute much in class as they are nervous about getting questions wrong. With Third Space, they can talk one-to-one with their tutor and if they get something wrong nobody else can hear it so they can sort out their mistakes really simply and easily.</p>

                  <h3>Cost effective one-to-one tutors</h3>
                  <p>We started it three years ago when the scheme was piloted and it worked well for our 6 pupils. Last year we did it with 12 pupils who, again, made superb progress, so this year we’ve put 20 pupils into Third Space and it’s been ideal. <strong>It’s a cost-effective way of getting one-to-one tutors</strong>, which we wouldn’t be able to get if we paid privately, so we thought it was a great resource to use.</p>
